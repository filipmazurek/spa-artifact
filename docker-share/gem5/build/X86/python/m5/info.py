README = "This is the gem5 simulator.\n\nThe main website can be found at http://www.gem5.org\n\nA good starting point is http://www.gem5.org/about, and for\nmore information about building the simulator and getting started\nplease see http://www.gem5.org/documentation and\nhttp://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction.\n\nTo build gem5, you will need the following software: g++ or clang,\nPython (gem5 links in the Python interpreter), SCons, zlib, m4, and lastly\nprotobuf if you want trace capture and playback support. Please see\nhttp://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building for more details\nconcerning the minimum versions of these tools.\n\nOnce you have all dependencies resolved, type 'scons\nbuild/<CONFIG>/gem5.opt' where CONFIG is one of the options in build_opts like\nARM, NULL, MIPS, POWER, SPARC, X86, Garnet_standalone, etc. This will build an\noptimized version of the gem5 binary (gem5.opt) with the the specified\nconfiguration. See http://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building for\nmore details and options.\n\nThe main source tree includes these subdirectories:\n   - build_opts: pre-made default configurations for gem5\n   - build_tools: tools used internally by gem5's build process.\n   - configs: example simulation configuration scripts\n   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5\n   - include: include files for use in other programs\n   - site_scons: modular components of the build system\n   - src: source code of the gem5 simulator\n   - system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems\n   - tests: regression tests\n   - util: useful utility programs and files\n\nTo run full-system simulations, you may need compiled system firmware, kernel\nbinaries and one or more disk images, depending on gem5's configuration and\nwhat type of workload you're trying to run. Many of those resources can be\ndownloaded from http://resources.gem5.org, and/or from the git repository here:\nhttps://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-resources/\n\nIf you have questions, please send mail to gem5-users@gem5.org\n\nEnjoy using gem5 and please share your modifications and extensions.\n"
